# Build a CNN for Image Classification

## Introduction:

This project focuses on building Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification, leveraging two distinct datasets: MNIST and Cats vs Dogs.

### Dataset:
- **MNIST Dataset:**
    - A collection of hand-written digits (0 to 9), widely used for introductory image classification tasks.

- **Cat vs Dogs Dataset:**
    - An image dataset containing pictures of cats and dogs, commonly used for more complex image classification challenges.

## Learning Objectives:

Upon completing this project, you will achieve the following learning objectives:

1. **Understand Conv2D and MaxPooling Layers:**
    - Gain a comprehensive understanding of the Conv2D and MaxPooling layers, fundamental building blocks in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

2. **Build a Simple ConvNet for Image Classification (MNIST Dataset):**
    - Learn to construct a simple ConvNet for image classification using the MNIST dataset, which involves recognizing hand-written digits.

3. **Build Another ConvNet for Image Classification (Cats vs Dogs Dataset):**
    - Extend your knowledge by building another ConvNet for image classification, this time using the Cats vs Dogs dataset, a more complex real-world dataset.

4. **Apply Data Augmentation:**
    - Explore and apply data augmentation techniques to enhance the diversity of the training dataset, leading to improved model generalization.

## Files Contained in the Project:

- **`CNN_For_Image_Classification.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook containing the project implementation and experimentation.
